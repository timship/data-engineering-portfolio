# Marketplace Data Platform

End-to-end data pipeline for marketplace analytics: S3 → Spark → Airflow → Greenplum

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a full data engineering pipeline, including data ingestion, transformation, orchestration, and loading into a Data Warehouse.

The pipeline processes marketplace product data and builds analytical datasets for downstream usage.

---

## 🧠 Business Goal

The goal of the project is to build an analytical data pipeline and create data marts with key metrics for marketplace analysis.

## 🔄 Pipeline Description

The pipeline consists of the following steps:

1. **Data ingestion**
   - Raw data is stored in S3 in parquet format

2. **Data processing (Spark)**
   - Data cleaning and transformation
   - Joins, aggregations, window functions
   - Feature enrichment

3. **Orchestration (Airflow)**
   - Spark job execution via SparkKubernetesOperator
   - Monitoring via SparkKubernetesSensor
   - SQL transformations in Greenplum

4. **Data Warehouse (Greenplum)**
   - External tables over S3
   - Analytical views and data marts

## 📊 Calculated Metrics

- `potential_revenue` — potential revenue from available stock  
- `total_revenue` — revenue considering returns  
- `avg_daily_sales` — average daily sales  
- `days_to_sold` — estimated days to sell remaining stock  
- `item_rate_percent` — ranking based on product rating  

---

## 📈 Data Marts

### 1. Brands Report
Aggregated metrics by brand:
- total revenue
- potential revenue
- number of items

### 2. Unreliable Sellers
Identification of unreliable sellers based on:
- long selling period
- mismatch between stock and orders

---

## 🚀 Results

- Processed over 1M records  
- Built full pipeline: Data Lake → Processing → DWH → Data Mart  
- Automated data pipeline with Airflow  
- Prepared analytical datasets for reporting
